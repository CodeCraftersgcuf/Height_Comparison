    <h2>How to Use Height Comparison Tool?</h2>
    <p class="content">We purposely created this free online tool to be uncomplicated and user-friendly, because you
        don’t need any added stress in your life! Let’s take things step by step on how to efficiently use this height
        comparison tool. Stick around to get the scoop on the multiple scenarios and reasons you can utilize this tool!
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1: Gathering your Measurements &amp; Subjects</h3>
    <p class="content">You can jump in and play around with measurements just for giggles, but if you’re looking to get
        an accurate take on a measuring scenario it would be best to know what you want to measure and what its
        measurements are ahead of time. If you aren’t sure of an exact measurement, you can always do a quick Google
        search or use your best guess!</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Entering your Data</h3>
    <p class="content">Time to punch in some numbers! As you’ll soon see, the Height Comparison website is very neat,
        organized, and simplistic, it’s designed this way to make this a breathable and enjoyable experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>On the left side of the main page, there are two rectangular panels. One is for creating a human subject to
            place on the size comparison chart, and the other is an object generator with the same goal in mind.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>For the human subject, you can customize their gender and name if you so please, and then but of course
            enter in their height in either feet (ft) or centimeters (cm). Plus, you can even pick out a color for them
            to be on the chart! Once you have put in those 4 simple details, you can submit the blue rectangle at the
            bottom of that panel that reads <strong>+ Add Person</strong>. They then will appear on the chart, ready for
            height comparison!</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Below the human subject panel is the&nbsp;<strong>Add Object</strong> panel. Here, you can choose from
            objects such as a closet, door, car, couch, or pick from a circle or rectangle shape to be able to customize
            the size.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content">Instead of submitting Add button, you simply just have to select the object you want, and it will
        appear on the chart. For the circle and rectangle shapes, once you have selected them and they pop on over to
        the chart there will be a drop-down menu option under the title Circle or Rectangle on the chart. You are able
        to select that and customize the size of the object.</p>
    <p class="content"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can adjust the size and height of the circle and rectangle by selecting
        its panel on the top-left side of the chart.</p>
    <p class="content">If you’d like to remove an object from the chart, simply select the&nbsp;<strong>close
            button</strong> next to the objects title and they’ll disappear; much like when you select the <strong>close
            button</strong> to get out of an internet page! Our height comparison chart shows the result in both cm and
        feet and inch.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Compare, Plan, Have Fun!</h3>
    <p class="content">Once you’ve got your people and or objects hanging out on the chart you can start your planning
        or fun comparing. This tool automatically converts measurements to centimeters to feet, and the other way around
        if you’d like. We provide measuring that you can trust!</p>
